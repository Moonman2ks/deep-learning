# deep-learning
<br/>Project was made by Gytis Kazlauskis from the group KT-8/2
<br/>The company I chose was Exxon Mobil, mainly because I'm interested in the development of oil companies in this world, where oil is starting to get replaced by other sources of energy.

<br/>**About the project**
<br/>This deep-learning project was the most interesting subject/course I had in this college yet. I was quite amazed how well RNN predicts the stock prices and I also hope that this experience will help me in the future.
**Difficulties I ran into**
<br/>This was the first time I even seen the python programming language, so it took me a while to get at least a little accustomed to it. <br/>Another problem was that docker wasn't really compatible with my OS (Windows 10 Home), so I had to use a Virtual Machine, which slowed down the learning process significantly.
<br/>**Conclusion**
<br/>In conclusion, even though the results could've been better, I think this was a fun experience, and it sure made me interested in deep-learning
